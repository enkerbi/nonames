                Before I left Gaya, I ate at older rinpoche’s house. <br>
                 I had beef stew with rice, and I sat directly across the dinner table from rinpoche’s assistant. I asked him about how they find the reincarnations of holy figures. <br> 
                  He told me the process is really difficult and they look for signs, and the process takes a few years. <br> <br>
                  Signs like flowers blooming in winter and rainbows on the day of birth. <br>
        
        Then he told me that our flight might be delayed because of the fog, and he told us to go to the younger rinpoches house. We didn’t go, we went to the airport straight. <br> <br>
        
        The car pulls up to the airport and we see that our flight to Bangkok has been delayed by three hours. <br>
        
        We decide go to the young rinpoches house. My moms friend tells me, I think they won’t let us fly until we visit young rinpoche. Lol. <br>
        
        At young rinpoches house we have carrot cake. My mom expresses her condolences to the young rinpoche. His uncle had died this year. <br> <br>
        
        He tells us, His Holiness told me that he will go to a good place. Maybe in a few years he come back, I will go look for a little uncle, he says circling his finger at the floor. <br>
        
        To love somebody in every life is crazy, this one and the next. <br>
        I think I believed in god for the first time. And I want to look for <a href="page5.html">you</a> in every life. <br>
